## Problem 1

## Create a data frame

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a random sample of size 8
from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
8 and a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor
    “levels”.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
set.seed(1)
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric>0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Jun","trying","to","get","eight"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("chocolate", "chocolate", "cookie", "cookie","cookie","cake","cake","cake"))
)
class(problem1_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] "numeric"

``` r
class(problem1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] "logical"

``` r
class(problem1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## [1] "character"

``` r
class(problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## [1] "factor"

``` r
levels(problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## [1] "cake"      "chocolate" "cookie"

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 0.1314544

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Result: I could get the mean of numeric and logical variables, but I can
not get the mean of character and factor variables.

Explanation: Because the numeric variable is a set of numbers, it is
easy to calculate the mean of it. As for logical variables, the system
recognizes TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it can calculate the mean of a
set of number 1 and 0. However, sice character and factor variables are
sets of words instead of numbers, the system cannot calculate the means
of them.

## data conversion

This chunk shows the conversion of different types of
variables.

``` r
as.numeric(problem1_df$vec_logical)#convert the logical vector to numeric
as.numeric(problem1_df$vec_logical)*problem1_df$vec_numeric#multiply the random sample by results
as.factor(problem1_df$vec_logical)#convert the logical vector to a factor
as.factor(problem1_df$vec_logical)*problem1_df$vec_numeric#multiply the random sample by results
as.numeric(as.factor(problem1_df$vec_logical))#convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric
as.numeric(as.factor(problem1_df$vec_logical))*problem1_df$vec_numeric#multiply the random sample by results
```

Results: I could get a valid results when I converted the logical
variable to numeric variable and multiplied random sample by results.
Also I could get a valid results when I converted the logical variable
to factor variable and then convert the result to numeric variable
before I multiplied random sample by results. However, I can not get a
valid results when I multiplied the randome sample by the results of
converting logical variable to factor variable. Because after we convert
other types of variable to numeric variable, there will be a set of
number which could be calculated by multiplying a random sample. And
factor variables is a set of words instead of numbers, the system cannot
calculate them by multiplying a random sample. I think it does help
explain what happens when I try to take the mean.

## Problem 2

# create datafram

This data fram comprised of: x: a random sample of size 500 from a
standard Normal distribution y: a random sample of size 500 from a
standard Normal distribution A logical vector indicating whether x + y
\> 1 A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector A
factor vector created by coercing the above logical vecto

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec2_logical = x+y > 1,
  vec2_numeric = as.numeric(vec2_logical),
  vec2_factor = as.factor(vec2_logical) 
)
```

## inline R code

As the data frame shows above, *the number of the rows of the dataset*
is 500, *the number of the column of the dataset* is 5; *the mean of x*
is 0.0196843, *the median of x* is-0.0384371, *the standard divation of
x* is 1.0137029; Besides, *the proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1*
is 0.252.

\#\#scatterplot \#\#\# scatterplot of y vs x with the color points using
the logical
variable

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = problem2_df$vec2_logical)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jy2965_files/figure-gfm/Scatterplot_logical-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_with_color_points_of_logical_variable.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

From the scatterplot above, we could find that nearly 50% of the logical
variables are true and 50% are
false.

### scatterplot of y vs x with the color points using the numeric variable

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = problem2_df$vec2_numeric)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jy2965_files/figure-gfm/Scatterplot_numeric-1.png)<!-- -->
From the scatterplot above, we could find that nearly 50% of the numeric
variables equal 1 and 50% equal
0.

### scatterplot of y vs x with the color points using the factor variable

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = problem2_df$vec2_factor)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_jy2965_files/figure-gfm/Scatterplot_factor-1.png)<!-- -->
From the scatterplot above, we could find that nearly 50% of the factor
variables are ture and 50% are false.
